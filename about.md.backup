My name is Eduardo Sell Gonçalves and I have obtained my PhD degree in December 2019 from the Institute of Physics, University of São Paulo (USP), São Paulo, Brazil.
Since 2020 I have been a postdoctoral researcher at the "Gleb Wataghin" Institute of Physics, UNICAMP,Campinas, Brazil. 
For both master's and doctoral degrees, as well as for my postdoc position, I was granted a fellowship from the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), one of the most prestigious funding agencies in Brazil.


I have shaped my academic path to study the light-matter interaction at the nanometer scale, a subject I am highly interested into. In particular, I have studied nonlinear optical properties and ultra-fast phenomena in sundry nanomaterials, from magnetic nanoparticles to graphene.  As an experimental physicist by formation, I have used a z-scan apparatus constructed by me to measure the two-photon absorption cross-section of nanoparticles in colloidal dispersion and in thin-films, determined the first order hyperpolarizability of MNPs by means of the hyper-Rayleigh scattering technique and studied the electronic dynamics of MNPs by means of a pump-probe experimental setup. 
When the access to the laboratory was suspended due to the COVID--19 outbreak, I have directed efforts to theoretical aspects of light and graphene interaction as a postdoctoral researcher. I have conducted numerical calculations on the electronics dynamics after the excitation due to ultra-short laser pulses.
